I have decided to rewrite [Jared](https://github.com/cyberarm/jared) (again.)

Jared has been sitting untouched for over a year and he could really use a face life :)

I am going to move his internal plugins in to separate gems, then create a plugin list over at jared-plugins.

And after that completely rewrite Jared to expect gems for plugins, and to use the [jared-plugins](https://github.com/cyberarm/jared-plugins) repository to find plugins.

I hope to have Jared at a true 1.0 by around Christmas.
